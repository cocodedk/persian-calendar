## Installation

### Installing the Release Build

To install the release version of the app on an Android device from the generated `app-release.aab` file, you will need to use `bundletool`.

**Prerequisites**

1.  **Android SDK:** Make sure you have the Android SDK installed and the `adb` command-line tool is in your system's PATH.
2.  **bundletool:** Download `bundletool` from the official [Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/bundletool).

**Steps**

1.  **Generate a universal APK from the AAB:**

    Use `bundletool` to generate a set of APKs from the `.aab` file. You will need the release keystore to sign the APKs. The keystore for this project is located at `keystore/1-release-key.jks`.

    ```sh
    java -jar /path/to/bundletool.jar build-apks \
      --bundle=release/app-release.aab \
      --output=release/app.apks \
      --mode=universal \
      --ks=keystore/1-release-key.jks \
      --ks-pass=pass:your_keystore_password \
      --ks-key-alias=your_key_alias \
      --key-pass=pass:your_key_password
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `/path/to/bundletool.jar` with the actual path to your `bundletool.jar` file. You will also need to provide the correct passwords for the keystore.

2.  **Install the APKs on your device:**

    With a device connected via `adb`, use `bundletool` to install the generated `.apks` file.

    ```sh
    java -jar /path/to/bundletool.jar install-apks \
      --apks=release/app.apks
    ```

    The application will then be installed on your device.
